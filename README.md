Chat application using Firebase's Realtime Database.


In the app, we will allow the user to log in with their Google account using Firebase's Google sign-in Authentication. We will also store and retrieve all the chatroom messages using Firebase's Cloud Firestore. 


# What is Firebase?

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (Baas). It is a Google-backed app development platform that allows developers to build iOS, Android, and web apps.

It provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, and creating marketing and product experiments. These help developers develop quality apps, grow their user base, and make a profit.

We will be using two of their tools: Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.

# Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication (SDK) is a Firebase tool that supports different authentication methods like passwords, phone numbers, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, and more. In this app, we will be using the Google sign-in Authentication.

# Cloud Firestore
Cloud Firestore is a cloud-based NoSQL database server for storing and syncing data. It stores data in documents as key-value pairs, and the documents are organized into collections.

The documents can also have sub-collections, allowing you to nest collections within collections. The data is also synchronized automatically among all devices listening for them.

Now that you have an idea of how Firebase and Cloud Firestore work, let's build our app.

Note: For this article's scope, I have already prewritten the CSS and prebuilt the components for the chat app. You can find the final project code on GitHub and the CSS and components in the setup folder. You can also view the final project with this live link.
